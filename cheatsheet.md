This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

**Command List:**
  Below exists a total list of commands avaiable to the player during the game.
  However, some of these commands are only useful when you are in certain cars,
  which is why the "help" command is location based. This means that it is useful
  to type "help" multiple times throughout the game, since it will show you what
  commands are useful to you based on your location.
  If you type a command that can't be used in your location, you will simply get an
  error message. That being said, here is the total list of available commands:
    help
    look around
    check pockets 
    inspect __ (works on people and items)
    talk to __  
    pick up __ 
    drop __
    use __ (need to have picked something up in order to use it)
    next car 
    previous car
    exit game
    exit train
    submit
    press button

# Summary of Plot (spoiler free)
You wake up on a train, unaware of where you are or how you got there. In your haze, you see a frog in a conductor’s outfit scan a keycard up to the train carriage exit door. As he exits the carriage, the keycard falls under a seat. You start to explore the carriage you’re in and talk to the passengers. It quickly becomes obvious that the people on this train don’t ever remember not being on it, nor do they remember it stopping. Different passengers have developed different theories as to the origin of the train, and one passenger tells you a legend of a large beast that once obstructed the tracks, stopping the train and killing all the passengers onboard. You shake it off and realize you don’t have a ticket. You think to proceed up through the carriages to find the frog conductor and ask him what to do. The end of the game involves a big twist and a choice that leads the player to either conform to the fear-based society of the train passengers, or to risk it all and save the train and its inhabitants.
